# What We Don't Know

  <span class="text-purple-400 font-bold">When does this actually become dangerous?</span>
  <br/>
  Current models aren't plotting world domination. Probably. But where's the line?

<div class="p-4 bg-purple-500/10 rounded-lg">
  <span class="text-purple-400 font-bold">Will our detection methods keep up?</span>
  <br/>
  We caught these behaviors. Will we catch the ones in models twice as capable?

<div class="p-4 bg-purple-500/10 rounded-lg">
  <span class="text-purple-400 font-bold">What are we not testing for?</span>
  <br/>
  By definition, we wouldn't know about the deceptions we haven't thought to look for.

# Anthropic's Own Words

<div class="p-6 bg-white/10 rounded-lg mt-8 font-mono text-lg">
  "Once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, <span class="text-red-400 font-bold">standard techniques could fail to remove such deception</span> and create a <span class="text-yellow-400 font-bold">false impression of safety</span>."
</div>

<div class="mt-8 text-xl">
  That's the company that makes Claude warning us about Claude.
</div>

<div class="mt-4 text-xl opacity-80">
  They're essentially saying: if this happens, we might not be able to fix it, and we might think we fixed it when we didn't.
